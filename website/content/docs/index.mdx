# Introduction

Text splitting for animations — without the jank.

<FettaDefinition />

## Why Fetta?

Text splitting sounds simple: wrap each character in a span. But fonts have kerning — subtle spacing adjustments that make text look right — and most libraries destroy it. Characters shift, typography breaks.

Fetta preserves original character positions, so your text looks exactly the same after splitting. Just animatable.

## Features

- **Kerning Compensation** — Maintains original character spacing after splitting
- **Auto-Revert** — Restore original HTML after animations
- **Line Detection** — Automatically groups words into lines
- **Responsive AutoSplit** — Re-splits on container resize
- **Built-in InView** — Viewport detection with `inView`, `onInView`, `onLeaveView`
- **Emoji Support** — Properly handles compound emojis and complex Unicode characters
- **Accessible** — Adds `aria-label` with original text for screen readers
- **TypeScript** — Full type definitions included
- **Framework Agnostic** — Works with vanilla JS, React, and any animation library

## Quick Example

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { SplitText } from 'fetta/react';
import { animate, stagger } from 'motion';

<SplitText
  onSplit={({ chars }) => {
    animate(chars, { opacity: [0, 1] }, { delay: stagger(0.02) });
  }}
>
  <h1>Hello world</h1>
</SplitText>
```
