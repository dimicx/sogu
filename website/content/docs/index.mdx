# Introduction

Text splitting for animations — without the jank.

<FettaDefinition />

## Why Fetta?

Text splitting sounds simple: wrap each character in a `<span>`. But fonts have kerning — subtle spacing adjustments between character pairs. Wrap each character in its own element and this spacing breaks.

Most splitting libraries don't account for this, including GSAP's [SplitText plugin](https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Plugins/SplitText/):

<KerningComparison />

Fetta measures character positions before splitting, then applies margin adjustments to preserve the original spacing after splitting.

## Features

- **Kerning Compensation** — Maintains original character spacing when splitting by chars
- **Nested Elements** — Preserves `<a>`, `<em>`, `<strong>` and other inline elements with all attributes
- **Line Detection** — Automatically groups words into lines
- **Dash Handling** — Allows text to wrap naturally after em-dashes and en-dashes
- **Auto Re-split** — Re-splits on container resize
- **Auto-Revert** — Restore original HTML after animations
- **Masking** — Wrap elements in clip containers for reveal animations
- **Emoji Support** — Properly handles compound emojis and complex Unicode characters
- **Accessible** — Automatic screen reader support, even when splitting text with nested links or emphasis
- **TypeScript** — Full type definitions included
- **React Component** — Declarative wrapper for React projects
- **Built-in InView** — Viewport detection for scroll-triggered animations in React
- **Library Agnostic** — Works with Motion, GSAP, or any animation library

## Browser Notes

**Safari**: Kerning compensation is not available in Safari because its text measurement doesn't accurately match the visual rendering. When using `revertOnComplete` with char splitting, font kerning is automatically disabled to prevent visual shift on revert.

## Quick Example

### Vanilla JavaScript

```ts title="main.ts"
import { splitText } from 'fetta';
import { animate, stagger } from 'motion';

const element = document.querySelector('h1');
const { chars } = splitText(element);

animate(chars, { opacity: [0, 1] }, { delay: stagger(0.02) });
```

### React

```tsx title="App.tsx"
import { SplitText } from 'fetta/react';
import { animate, stagger } from 'motion';

<SplitText
  onSplit={({ chars }) => {
    animate(chars, { opacity: [0, 1] }, { delay: stagger(0.02) });
  }}
>
  <h1>Hello world</h1>
</SplitText>
```
